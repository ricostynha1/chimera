 * @author Andrey Filippov     
 *
 * @brief Part of the Huffman encoder for JPEG compressor - variable length encoder.
 * Used double clock rate, superseded by varlen_encode_snglclk, left for comparison.
 * 
 * Encoder will work 2 cycles per "normal" word, 1 cycle for codes "00" and "f0",
 * only magnitude output is needed ASAP (2 cycles, the value out should be
 * valid on the 5-th cycle - it will latency 4 cycles run each other cycle.
 * Later implementsed a shortcut - all codes processed in 2 cycles.
